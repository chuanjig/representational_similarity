# representational_similarity

Scripts I wrote to analyze neural data using searchlight representational similarity analysis (RSA), for an upcoming publication (Wasserman, Chakroff, Saxe, & Young, submitted). My previous commits on this project were made as @lypsychlab.

For this project we:

* analyzed similarities between neural patterns associated with viewing different kinds of moral violations to discover brain regions containing information about different types of moral content
* performed K-means cluster analysis on weights derived from a principal component analysis of behavioral ratings of the same moral violations, as an attempt to discover whether moral categories could be reconstituted from feature information alone 
* analyzed neural similarities _within_ brain regions that encode category information, to see whether feature information was also encoded
